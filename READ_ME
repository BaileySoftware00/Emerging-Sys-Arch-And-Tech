#The projects I uploaded are solving the problem of creating an interrupt in an SOS system and echoing inputs of a user.
#For these projects I think I organized them well. I think I broke down the steps into functions well to help keep the code organized and easy to read.
#I could improve my naming conventions and in-code comments.
#these projects allowed me to add a better understanding of embedded systems and the transfer of data through a UART.
#The skills I gained from these projects are better problem compartmentalizing and researching niche issues that arise in coding
#I make my code maintainable readable and accessible by breaking down the functions of the codes into individualized functions in the code. I also made my variables size_x to allow for dynamic suze changes for adaptive scaling.
